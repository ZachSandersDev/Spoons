# Spoons

> Spoons is an app I made for my partner!

## Context 

It's based on the *spoons theory* that's used to help neuro-diverse people manage and understand their energy capacity. 

Every task requires a certain number of "spoons". Some days you'll have more spoons available, some days you'll have less. And everyone has a different capacity for getting things done throughout the day.

Whether it's emotional, physical or mental, everyone has limits on what they can resonably do in a day.

## How Spoons addresses this

Spoons is a task app like any other, except it *limits how many tasks you can see by default*. You can set a base number of points you expect to be able to complete in a day, and Spoons will only show you the tasks that will fit in that limit.

If you fill your spoons goal for the day, you're free to add more capacity if you're feeling productive! Or, you can rest easy having accomplished your goal.
